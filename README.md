# Restaurant reviews Web app


## To run 

cd restaurants 

npm i 


cd server 

npm i 


cd .. 
(we are back into 'restaurants' directory)   


npm start

open browser at http://localhost:8000/


Notes:
- in order to test - making  a review while offline - disconnect the computer from internet (not only from Chrome > Dev. tools)
- I have reduced the boilerplate code but I am sure it can be halved
- diffrent implementation of loading pictures
